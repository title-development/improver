      phone number, school, etc.) unless
      supervised by a parent or responsible adult.<br>
      <i class="imp-icon-dot-circled"></i> Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are
      appropriate.<br>
      <i class="imp-icon-dot-circled"></i> Look for website privacy policies and know how your child’s information is
      treated.<br><br>
